# Welcome to the Hi3Mirror wiki!
We just moved to Github for making this wiki (also making it more organized).

## Introduction
### So, what is Hi3Mirror?<br/>
Basically, this is an **Update Server Mirror** for **[Honkai Impact 3rd](https://honkaiimpact3.mihoyo.com/)** Game made by **[miHoYo](https://www.mihoyo.com/)**.<br/><br/>
This project was actually been exist since v4.7 patch but for limited amount of players in the [Official SEA Fans Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2088915844672714) and Ironmaiden's Armada Discord Server which some of them have problem while updating the game using default update server. Some of the problems are 1003x and 1001x error, also "**endless elevator problem**" (which has been fixed in v4.9 patch).
